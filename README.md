# Exploiting RL to find optimal strategy in dynamic maps 


1. Assume that there are many state for model to explore beacause the enemy move in R and agent move in Z. 
   Try to do: round the position of enemy to make the decision of agent more simple
 	      add more information about the tile that agent is standing to push the agent get out from the safe tile. By adding reward everytime it moving out the safe place and punishing evey moment it stands in there.
